# Library-Console-App
The Adding & Borrowing CLI App is a simple Python project designed for beginners who want to:

*  practice file storage (text)

*  understand functions, modules, and packaging

*  build a useful tool for keeping track of borrowed items or amounts

The app lets you add new borrow records, list all records, remove records, and mark borrowed items as returned — all through simple terminal commands.
